This is a traveling guide website(dummy). On this website, I used React Routes, Session Storage, Bootstrap 5, GitHub API, and UseState. There is a section in which you can take users' reviews and they can see your Tourists List and they can watch a trailer of Tour.

Here is the Demo: https://trvl-343.netlify.app/
